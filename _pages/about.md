Brief description and aims of the course
======

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world. Medicine is no exception, and several AI applications can already be used today to help both patients and clinicians. In this course, physicians will learn several aspects of AI, how to train AI models for various use cases, and use their domain-specific knowledge to create advanced applications to solve their day-to-day problems improving their efficiency and patient care. Real- world medical data comprising images, text reports, and clinical databases will be used during the workshop.

The objectives of this course are to:
- Understand the different types of AI models;
- Understand the types of tasks that AI models can perform;
- Present several success stories of AI in Medicine;
- Discuss common mistakes and the importance of domain-specific knowledge;
- Introduce participants to Python, Jupyter, and Google Colab;
- Know publicly available datasets;
- Learn to create use AI to analyze medical images in regression, classification, and segmentation use cases;
- Learn to create 3D digital patient/organ-specific models for surgical planning.

Educational methods
======
The teaching methodology of the course focuses heavily on a practical component so that students learn by doing, which will be complemented by plenary lectures.
